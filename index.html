        okay, but why?
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>april 3rd 2021</b>: matt has to submit a last-minute QA approval for acm board officer applications. he breaks the QA approval timeline rule of 1 week, and <b>thus must pay.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>april 8th 2021</b>: matt learns about updating the discover engineering banner late, and must submit a last-minute QA approval for a new banner. he breaks the QA approval timeline rule of 1 week, and <b>thus must pay.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>july 10th 2021</b>: acm tables creating a zoom background for NSO and matt puts together a haphazard design. Crystal swoops in to save the day (from matt). he breaks the QA approval timeline rule of 1 week, and <b>thus must pay.</b>

        <code>2<sup>n</sup></code> favours for <code>n</code> infractions
      </p>
      <h3>
        how long do the favours last until?

        </ol>
      </p>
